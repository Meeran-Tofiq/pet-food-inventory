# pet-food-inventory

This is a project made for the Express section of The Odin Project. It is designed
to showcase my abilities in setting up an Express environment, connect to a mongoDB
databse, and create models to use with the database. I have also added image support
for forms, and in use with the whole backend.

On this website, users can create their own pet food categories for any animal that
the user wants. And can make their own pet foods for each category. Users can then
update, or delete, these categories and pet foods, if they so desire.
